# Plasma Update

# 关于Plasma的更新

### Part 1

This post covers production only - the research update wasn’t ready for press time so we’ll be posting that tomorrow.

这篇内容只是针对线上产品。研究工作方面的更新会等我们整理好后再发布。

It’s dash to the holidays - and it’s been a productive sprint and we’re trying to get as much done as we can before the new year.

假期就要来临，而我们通过了一个高效的迭代周期来尽可能地在新年前完成更多的工作。

After all the refactoring, we’ve implemented the More Viable Plasma in-flight exit for ETH in our root chain contracts. 
This is a big step forward for us, as it clears a major hurdle toward integration. 
With this out of the way, integration of the child chain and watcher with the updated contract can now move forward.

经过我们的重构工作, 在根链合约上，我们实现了为以太网络开发的MoreVP里进行状态下的退出机制(in-flight exit)。这对我们来说又向前迈进了一大步,因为这项任务为我们扫清了后面集成工作的主要障碍。没了这层阻碍后，我们可以继续进行子链和在更新状态下合约监视器的集成工作。

We’ve also finalized our updated child chain and watcher APIs so that they are both internally consistent and consistent with the eWallet. 
We now have a consistent OmiseGO-styled API format across all our services. This will make integration faster, easier, and generally more 
pleasant to work with.

我们也完成了更新状态下子链和监视器的API, 目的是让它们内部之间保持接口的一致性，这方面也会和钱包应用保持一致。在我们所有系统服务中，你都可以见到这种具有OmiseGO风格的API。这样会让集成工作更加简洁明了和高效。


The rebuild of the internal testnet is on track to be finished this week. We now have the entire tool chain in place to easily 
deploy new iterations of the network, along with all the needed production support services such as metrics, telemetry, alerts, 
and logging. This testnet will be made available to early partners immediately. 
We will initially deploy Minimal Viable Plasma; this will be a relatively small window while we prove out all of our tooling.
Once all the feature development finishes for More Viable Plasma, we’ll quickly upgrade the testnet (still internal) to MoreVP - 
this is the version that, once we’re satisfied with it, goes on to become the public testnet.

内部测试网络的重建会按照规划在这周完成。现在，我们准备好了一整套工具来轻松地部署网络中的服务流程，包括矩阵,自动记录,告警和日志服务。测试网会立即为早期的合作者开放。在最初，我们会部署MVP (Minimal Viable Plasma), 这会给我们的工具带来一个小试牛刀的验证机会。当所有为MoreVP准备的功能开发完成后，我们会立即在内部升级测试网络到MoreVP版本, 这会是一个让我们满意的版本，以确保它能够发展成为我们的测试公网。

That takes us right into the next year. From everyone on the plasma team, we wish everyone a happy holiday season, 
whatever you might choose to celebrate!

我们会带着这些计划进入下一年的工作。对于所有Plasma团队的人，我们祝愿大家都能够以自己方式来度过一个美好的假期

### Part 2

First, our apologies for the delay in posting this second installment - it's a very busy week as everybody tries to knock out their to-do lists before the holidays.

首先，我们为这次迟来的更新感到抱歉，这周是繁忙的一周，大家都忙于在假期来临前把自己的任务完成。

Plasma researchers converged at ETHSingapore over the weekend of December 7-9. As usual, this convergence provided the opportunity for researchers to consolidate their recent findings and push forward with some new ideas.

Plasma的研发人员在12月7号到9号在新加坡ETHSingapore活动上汇聚一堂。像往常一样，这次活动给了我们一些机会让研发人员来汇总分享他们的新发现，以及推进一些新的想法。


Plasma Prime was the flavor of the week, and one of the biggest challenges continues to be how to keep histories as compact as possible. There has been something of a laser focus on this since it’s probably the biggest challenge before Plasma Prime is ready to go to market. It will be the subject of a lot of the research, modeling and experimentation over the next few weeks, until there’s some kind of consensus on the optimal way to go about it.

Plasma Prime 是这周的热点， 最大的挑战在于如何把历史记录尽可能的压缩。这是Plasma Prime推向市场前最大的挑战，我们一直在集中精力研究它。我们会在未来几周为它进行大量的研究工作，建模和实验，一直到找到一种最优的共识方案。

For a bit of background on that: somewhat counterintuitively, it’s far easier to prove succinctly that a coin has been spent than to prove that it has not been. To prove a spend you only need to reference one block in order to verify a spend transaction (the block in which the transaction occurred), while proving that a coin has not been spent requires verification that the coin hasn’t been unspent in every block between its deposit onto the Plasma chain to the head of the Plasma chain. This means that if you want to spend a coin that has been stored in your account for a year, it’s necessary to verify a year’s worth of blocks in order to be sure that the spend is valid...which is a lot of blocks.

接下来了解释下这个问题的一些背景信息，会让你感到意外的是，证明一块钱被花出远比证明这一块钱未被花掉更简单。你可以查看一个在序列中的区块信息来验证花费（交易已经打包到这个区块），而去证明这一块钱未被花掉却需要查看从存入到Plasma链到Plasma链头部所有的区块信息。这意味着，如果你想花费一枚在你账户里呆了一年的货币，系统需要查看这一年所有的区块来确保这枚货币是可以花出的，这可是需要大量的区块信息来验证。


We (and by we, we mean the whole cohort of plasma contributors, not just OmiseGO) haven’t settled on the ideal way to address this. We’re still evaluating whether we’ll eventually go with the RSA accumulator approach that was proposed early on in Plasma Prime research for reducing the history size that proves that a spend of a given coin hasn’t occurred. We’re also looking into Snjax’s proposal to use SNARKs/STARKs as an alternative to Plasma Prime’s RSA accumulators.

我们(包括所有Plasma的贡献者，不单指OmseGo团队)都还没有找到解决这个问题的理想方案，我们还在评估最终的两个方案，一个利用在Plasma Prime研究中提出的RSA累加器来减少历史记录的体积，这样可以用来证明未花费的问题。我们也在调研Srjax提出的 SNARKs/STARKs方案，这是可以看做RSA累加器的替代方案。

Of course, researchers love a challenge. We're looking forward to solving this puzzle and sharing the results - and here's to another year of discoveries!

当然，挑战永远是研发人员的最爱。我们将继续研究这一难题并分享我们的工作成果。祝愿新的一年里有更多的发现。

Please note that we'll be a bit quiet over the holiday weeks to give our team some breathing room to spend time with their families and recharge. Our regularly scheduled updates will resume on January 7.

在接下来的一两周里，我们团队成员将处于休假状态，他们会与家人享受假期，放松身心,然后再重返岗位。我们的日常更新会在1月7号恢复。
