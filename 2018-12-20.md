# Plasma Update

# 关于Plasma的更新

This post covers production only - the research update wasn’t ready for press time so we’ll be posting that tomorrow.

这篇文章只针对线上产品。研发方面的更新会等我们整理好后再发布。

It’s dash to the holidays - and it’s been a productive sprint and we’re trying to get as much done as we can before the new year.

假期就要来临，这是一个高效的开发周期，我们尽可能的在新年前完成更多的事情。

After all the refactoring, we’ve implemented the More Viable Plasma in-flight exit for ETH in our root chain contracts. 
This is a big step forward for us, as it clears a major hurdle toward integration. 
With this out of the way, integration of the child chain and watcher with the updated contract can now move forward.

经过这些重构， 我们实现了更具备多态的以太Plasma，在我们的根链合约上。

We’ve also finalized our updated child chain and watcher APIs so that they are both internally consistent and consistent with the eWallet. 
We now have a consistent OmiseGO-styled API format across all our services. This will make integration faster, easier, and generally more 
pleasant to work with.

我们也完成对我们子链的更新，和监控APi, 所以他们保持了一致，也会钱包应用保持了一致。
在我们的服务中，我们使用了一致的OmiseGO样式的API格式.这会让集成更加快速，方便，用起来也很愉悦。

The rebuild of the internal testnet is on track to be finished this week. We now have the entire tool chain in place to easily 
deploy new iterations of the network, along with all the needed production support services such as metrics, telemetry, alerts, 
and logging. This testnet will be made available to early partners immediately. 
We will initially deploy Minimal Viable Plasma; this will be a relatively small window while we prove out all of our tooling.
Once all the feature development finishes for More Viable Plasma, we’ll quickly upgrade the testnet (still internal) to MoreVP - 
this is the version that, once we’re satisfied with it, goes on to become the public testnet.

内部测试网络的重建会按照规划在这周完成。现在，我们有一整套工具链在方便地部署新的周期在网络里，加上所有需要的产品支持服务。像矩阵,telemery,告警和日志.
测试网会立即为早期的合作者开放。我们会在开始部署一个最小化的Plasma, 这会为我们测试我们的工具提供一个时间窗口。当所有的功能开发完成后，我们会升级测试网
到moreVP, 这是一个让我们满意的版本，会演化成为公开的测试网络

That takes us right into the next year. From everyone on the plasma team, we wish everyone a happy holiday season, 
whatever you might choose to celebrate!

这会引导我们去明年。对于所有Plasma团队的人， 我们祝愿大家享受一个美好的假期，不管你选择怎样度过
